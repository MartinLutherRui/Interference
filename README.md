# Interference
IPW estimators of causal effect estimands in the presence of interference

The estimands  of Halloran & Hudgens describe average potential outcomes (in groups or population)
under counterfactual treatment allocation that have a two-stage randomization design. In those
counterfactual treatment allocation, the direct effect describes changes in the average potential
outcome under treatment and control when treatment in the remaining of the neighbors is assigned
as independent Bernoulli trials with some fixed probability $\alpha$.
